          Hello! I'm Jess, an Information Technology graduate passionate about building intuitive and purposeful digital experiences.  
          <br /><br />
          During my academic years and internship, I honed my backend skills using .NET, developed mobile apps with Flutter, and built responsive websites using React and Tailwind.
          <br /><br />
          I enjoy collaborating on meaningful projects, learning new tech, and creating tools that bring value to users. Whether it's through efficient code, clear documentation, or seamless UI/UX—I strive to deliver work that speaks for itself.
          <br /><br />
          When I’m not coding, I love exploring ideas on freelancing, business, and tech innovations that solve real-world problems.
